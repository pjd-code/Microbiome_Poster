DNA isolation, amplification, and sequencing

DNA was isolated from 300 to 1,000 microliters of nasal wash, 1ml of BAL, or 1ml sterile water as a control using the DNeasy® PowerSoil® Kit (Qiagen) and a slightly modified extraction protocol. Briefly, 200ul of the buffer was removed from the PowerBead® tube and 60ul of solution C1 was added along with the sample to be processed. Samples were incubated at 65 °C for 10 minutes and then agitated on a FastPrep-24 for 60s at 6.0 m/s. The subsequent steps were done according to the PowerSoil quick-start protocol. The final elution was done with 50 ul of nuclease free water and stored at -20 °C until the amplification step. 
PCR amplification was done using 515F-806RB (Caporaso 2011) primers that amplify the V4 hypervariable region of the 16s rRNA gene. 4ul of DNA and 1.6uL of each 806RB barcoded reverse primer (5uM) were added to a 96 well plate along with 19.4 microliters of a master mix consisting of 0.8uL forward primer 515F (10uM), 0.5uL dNTPs (10mM), 5uL 5X Q5 buffer,0.35uL Q5 Hot Start HiFi enzyme (New England BioLabs Inc.), and 12.75uL Nuclease-Free Water. The negative control consisted of 4ul nuclease free water with a positive control of ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard (Zymo Research). The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 minutes followed by 33 cycles of 94 °C for 30 seconds, 55 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 90 seconds, followed by 72 °C for 10 minutes ending with a 4 °C hold. 

Reactions were bead cleaned on the Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform (Agilent Technologies) using 0.65x volume of AMPure XP Beads (Agencourt), washed twice with 80% ethanol and eluted with 20 µL low TE, pH 8.0. Eluted PCR products were quantified with a Quant-iT™ double-stranded DNA High-Sensitivity Assay Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and read on a Tecan Spark Microplate Reader. The libraries were then pooled with equal input mass and each pool was re-purified with 0.65× volume of AMPure XP Beads (Agencourt). All pools were quantified on a HSD1000 ScreenTape with the Agilent TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technologies). The pool was quantified by qPCR with the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems) on the Roche 480 LightCycler system. The final library was paired-end sequenced at 2?×?250 (New York University) using a MiSeq Illumina Sequencer. The process was repeated for any sample that generated less than 10,000 reads after demultiplexing, using 8 µl of input DNA for the initial PCR reaction. 

Sequence Processing

The 16s rRNA gene sequences were processed using QIIME 2™ microbiome analysis package version 2018.11.  The samples were demultiplexed using the demux emp-paired method from the QIIME2 demux plugin. Following demultiplexing the samples were dereplicated, chimera filtered, and paired-end read merged with DADA2 plugin. Reads with an expected value of more than 2 errors were discarded. The error model that detected the errors was trained using the default setting of 1,000,000 reads.  Chimeras were detected and discarded using the consensus method; meaning they were detected individually, and chimeric sequences found in 1-fold greater abundance than their parent samples were removed. Dereplication with DADA2 results in pools of reads that are 100% identical to each other. The dereplicated sequences were then open reference clustered using the VSEARCH plugin. The sequences were clustered against the Greengenes 13-8 library at 97% identity. In addition, any sequences that did not match the reference were clustered de novo.  Taxonomy assignments were made using the classify-sklearn plugin. The classify-sklearn plugin is a naïve Bayes classifier, for this analysis it was trained on the Greengenes 13_8 99% OTUs from the 515F/806 R sequence region.
